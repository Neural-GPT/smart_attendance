# SMART ATTENDANCE

### Description  
**Smart Attendance** is an intelligent Android app that automates student attendance using **computer vision** and **machine learning**.  
No more roll calls — students’ faces are recognized automatically, and their attendance is marked instantly. In the app, the embeddings graph represents the x-y graph of 
embeddings (128 dimensional vector unique to each image and label) generated by the MobileFaceNet model. CL represents the confidence level of the model in its prediction and RMS value represents the root mean square value of the embeddings generated.

### Problem Statement  
1. Teachers must manually mark attendance for each student — repetitive and time-consuming.  
2. Attendance needs to be taken separately in every class.  
3. This wastes valuable teaching time and human effort, which can easily be automated.

---

### Proposed Solution  
1. Our **Smart Attendance App** leverages **AI-based face recognition** to automate attendance.  
2. Each student is identified through facial features in real time.  
3. Attendance is automatically recorded without manual intervention.
